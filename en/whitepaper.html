    # HABEO
    <BR /><BR />
    ## Vision
    We are looking forward to a world where every single individual can have access to the new crypto systems.
    Our goal is to simplify the way digital objects are acquired, swapped and transferred while lowering the fees
    incurred in such transactions.
    We want people to feel safe and comfortable sending and receiving digital objects as part of everyday transactions.
    With HABEO individuals will be able to quickly and easily use it in exchange for goods and services from small to
    large in a practical and secure way.
    Although today this may seem utopic, HABEO is here to spearhead the effort to accomplish this goal.

    <BR />
    ## Name
    HABEO - this is a word from the Latin language that has multiple meanings: have, accept, hold, keep, take, possess,
    do, consider, cultivate, foster, control and direct.

    All of these meanings align with our vision for the token so we absolutely believe this name is a perfect fit for
    it.

    <BR />
    ## Key features summary
    * **Fair early distribution**: Our early distribution eliminates the need for a third party. Anyone interested in
    acquiring the token during the early distribution period has to simply send a pre-established amount of BNB to the
    contract and the contract will provide the sender with the corresponding number of tokens. The early distribution
    period has clear dates and clear limits. Only one operation is allowed per wallet.
    * **Layered taxation**: We believe that not all operations should be taxed the same. Some transactions need to have
    very low fees while others should be contributing a larger share. We’ve implemented what we think is a very fair tax
    structure.
    * **Throttled swaps at exchange**: To make the token more stable, we’ve enabled throttling in the amount of swap
    operations per wallet per day. The number of transfers between wallets is not limited. But swap operations need to
    happen at least 8 hrs. apart.
    * **Limit on the size of transactions**: Transactions between wallets have a size limit. It’s a high limit but we
    think it will help with market stability. After the token becomes widely adopted, this limit will become obsolete
    and will hardly ever be reached.
    * **Dividends through reflections**: Everytime a transaction is taxed, 45% of the tax is redistributed among each
    and every one of the token owners in a proportional way.
    * **Auto LP**: Right after the early distribution period ends, all the accumulated BNB becomes liquidity for HABEO.
    After the initial liquidity, the protocol will continuously add to the pool in a balanced and predictive way by
    liquifying 45% of the collected taxes.
    * **Auto burn**: At the time of the closing of the early distribution period, HABEO will burn 50% of the supply.
    HABEO will continue burning tokens (10% of the taxes) until the supply end goal is reached. Then, burning will
    automatically stop, forever.
    * **Burn wallet special feature**: This burn wallet is like no other. It will eat up reflections while burning is
    still active but, when the limit is reached, it will stop receiving reflections. This will increase the dividends
    that all participating accounts receive from then on.
    * **Ownership renounced**: We built it for everyone, so no one has ownership over it.
    * **LP Locked forever**: HABEO is here to stay. Liquidity tokens are sent to the burn wallet.
    * **Donations for the dev team**: We’ve enabled a mechanism to receive donations for the team. If you feel like
    thanking the team with some coins, you can do that very easily.

    <BR />
    ## Key numbers
    * **Total supply of HABEO at deployment**: 1,000,000,000,000,000 HABEO (1 quadrillion)
    * **Max days early distribution is available**: 30 days
    * **Max number of BNB to collect at early distribution**: 3,086 BNB (at least 2,500)
    * **Burn at launch**: 500,000,000,000,000 HABEO (500 trillion)
    * **Total supply of HABEO after last burn**: 25,000,000,000,000 HABEO (25 trillion)
    * **Min and Max taxation**: 2% - 60%
    * **Portion of tax used for reflection**: 45%
    * **Portion of tax used for auto LP**: 45%
    * **Portion of tax used for burn**: 10%

    ## Features explained

    <BR />
    ### Fair early distribution
    First and foremost, only one request for HABEO is allowed per wallet.
    Our early distribution period starts the day we deploy HABEO and will be open for 30 days OR until the BNB goal is
    reached. Whatever happens first.
    We think that approximately 2500 BNB is a great number to start the liquidity pool with so we set up the swap value
    structure in a way that will result in a pool between 2,500 and 3,086 BNB.
    If by day 30 the target is not reached, the early distribution period will be automatically closed.
    Once the early distribution is done, no one will be able to acquire HABEO at a fixed number of BNB through that
    direct channel.
    When we reach this stage, all the BNB collected will automatically be sent to the PancakeSwap HABEO/BNB pair
    together with the remaining to form the initial liquidity pool.
    The number of remaining tokens will depend on the results of the early distribution following this formula:

    Total Supply - Initial Burn - Tokens Distributed = Tokens at initial LP paired with the resulting BNB

    There are 7 different options to obtain HABEO at the early distribution process that result in a variable number of
    tokens that can be acquired on each operation.

    The options are as follows:

    * 25 BNB will distribute 1,806,250,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000013841 BNB x HABEO (27.75% fewer compared to 5 BNB)
    * 10 BNB will distribute 850,000,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000011765 BNB x HABEO (15% fewer compared to 5 BNB)
    * 5 BNB will distribute 500,000,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000010000 BNB x HABEO (Sweet spot)
    * 1 BNB will distribute 90,000,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000011110 BNB x HABEO (10% fewer compared to 5 BNB)
    * 0.5 BNB will distribute 40,500,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000012340 BNB x HABEO (19% fewer compared to 5 BNB)
    * 0.2 BNB will distribute 16,200,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000012340 BNB x HABEO (Same proportion to 0.5 BNB)
    * 0.1 BNB will distribute 8,100,000,000 HABEO = 0.000000000012340 BNB x HABEO (Same proportion to 0.2 BNB)

    We’ve decided that for the early distribution, we will not use any intermediaries. As HABEO automatically adds the
    tokens to the LP, we do not want any charges for acquiring tokens. Not for us, not for anyone wanting to join the
    project.
    Simply send the amount of BNB that you want to join with to the contract address and the contract will send the
    right amount of HABEO to your wallet.
    The reason for the different valuations at the different layers is to encourage everyone to acquire enough but not
    too many tokens. To accomplish this, we made it less of a value to become an instant whale, while also allowing
    smaller wallets to get a decent deal.
    We think that 500,000,000,000 tokens is an ideal number of tokens for people to acquire so we set that amount as the
    ideal number of tokens to acquire during the early distribution in relation to the BNB provided. We cannot prevent
    anyone from acquiring more tokens using different wallets, but we can make getting a very big wallet a little less
    interesting.

    <BR />
    ### Layered taxation
    This key feature makes HABEO the most fair token in the ecosystem.
    We want to encourage the use of HABEO for day to day operations, we want to encourage the community to acquire
    HABEO, we want to encourage the community to swap some HABEO for other tokens but, we want to discourage our holders
    from releasing large amounts of HABEO all at once.
    Everyone is still free to swap all their holdings at once, but the tax will be high.

    This is the layered taxation table:
    * Acquisition from exchange: 2% tax
    * Transfer between accounts: 2% tax
    * Swap at exchange:
    * Up to 1% of the wallet’s balance: 2% tax
    * Up to 2% of the wallet’s balance: 4% tax
    * Up to 3% of the wallet’s balance: 6% tax
    * Up to 4% of the wallet’s balance: 8% tax
    * Up to 5% of the wallet’s balance: 10% tax
    * Up to 10% of the wallet’s balance: 20% tax
    * Up to 20% of the wallet’s balance: 30% tax
    * Up to 40% of the wallet’s balance: 40% tax
    * Up to 75% of the wallet’s balance: 50% tax
    * Up to 100% of the wallet’s balance: 60% tax

    Although all holders can swap all their holdings at a lower tax rate by executing multiple transactions, this will
    take time (because of the throttled swap operations) so it won’t impact the token valuation against other tokens as
    much in a short period of time.

    <BR />
    ### Throttled swaps at exchange
    In combination with the layered taxation, we have implemented a limit in the number of swaps at the exchange that
    wallets can execute in a certain period of time.
    We don’t want HABEO to be a pump and dump style of token nor for the whales to easily impact its swapping value.
    HABEO is limited to execute swap transactions at exchanges with 8 hrs cool down periods. This gives everyone the
    ability to acquire or swap HABEO three times per day at the most.
    Once a transaction is submitted by a wallet, 8 hrs must pass for the next transaction attempt to be successful.
    We think this is a very good mechanism to minimize the chances of pump and dump operations.

    <BR />
    ### Limit on the size of transactions
    While transactions to and from the exchanges do not have size limits, transactions between different wallets have a
    limit of 10,000,000,000 HABEO per transaction.
    As transactions between wallets do not have a cool down period, anyone that needs it can transfer more HABEO using
    multiple transactions.
    This limit might seem constraining at the time because in the beginning, some wallets hold a high number of tokens.
    However, as the popularity of HABEO and the number of wallets increase, this limit will start looking less and less
    of a constraint to the point that it will look anecdotal.
    We feel that this number is a good balance that will help with the growth and will definitely become a distant
    memory once we reach full throttle.

    <BR />
    ### Dividends through reflections
    As introduced by previous tokens, HABEO includes reflections as a way to reward holders.
    Part of the tax from every transaction (45% of it, to be precise) is distributed among the holders of the token.
    This means, EVERY WALLET receives a portion of the distribution.
    The size of the slice each wallet receives is proportional to the number of HABEO the wallet holds at the time of
    the operation.
    Wallets with more HABEO receive more rewards.
    Basically, this is a sort of dividend that’s allocated immediately to the wallets participating in the project.

    <BR />
    ### Auto LP
    As we’ve mentioned before, the end of the early distribution process triggers the first event of auto LP in the
    protocol.
    This event however, is not the only auto LP event that will happen with HABEO.
    Part of the tax from every transaction (45% of it, to be precise) is collected towards periodically adding liquidity
    to the LP.
    HABEO accumulates the fees over a period of time until they reach 100,000,000 HABEO.
    Once this number is reached, the protocol swaps half of the tokens from the fees for BNB through PancakeSwap.
    Once the BNB has been received, HABEO uses these BNBs and the remaining half of the tokens and sends them to
    PancakeSwap to add to the LP.
    This is the right way to add liquidity without affecting the swapping value.

    <BR />
    ### Auto burn
    As you may have noticed, we have accounted for only 90% of the tax fees so far.
    The remaining 10% is sent to the burn wallet.
    When closing the early distribution process, the burn wallet receives 500,000,000,000,000 HABEO effectively halving
    the amount of HABEO in circulation forever.
    As we want HABEO to be truly deflationary, we set the protocol to continue the burn at small increments.
    This way, the amount in circulation keeps getting lower and the scarcity adds pressure for HABEO’s swapping value to
    consistently rise.
    As the burn effectively happens by sending tokens to the burn wallet, this wallet will be the largest holder of
    HABEO for a while. This means that the burn wallet will be receiving reflections at a higher rate than any other
    wallet and thus accelerating the deflationary aspect of HABEO.
    However, as we do not want HABEO to burn all of the supplies, we have set a limit to the amount of HABEO that will
    be burnt to a total of 975,000,000,000,000 HABEO.
    At the end of the burning process, there will only be 25,000,000,000,000 HABEO in circulation.
    This is exactly 2.5% of the initial supply.

    <BR />
    ### Burn wallet special feature
    The fact that the burn wallet is the largest wallet out there, helps with burning HABEO faster but, on the flip
    side, lowers the amount of dividends that each wallet receives when transactions are taxed.
    That’s why we’ve built a great feature that will reward long time holders.
    When HABEO is done with the burning, the burn wallet will be stripped from the privilege of earning reflections
    which means every other wallet will dramatically increase their holding share and thus will earn reflections at a
    much faster rate.
    This is the fairest way to reward holders for their continued support.

    <BR />
    ### Ownership renounced
    There are usually certain maintenance needs that contracts have (for example, adding/removing exchanges) that
    justify the developers/creators of the contract to retain ownership.
    When developers retain the ownership of the contract, they create a situation in which holders need to trust them
    and their loyalty. This situation hinders the ability to fully trust and fully commit to the project.
    We have built functionality into the contract that gives us the ability to easily include exchanges when they
    onboard HABEO to their listings.
    This way we do not have the need to retain ownership of the contract so the ownership is being renounced at the time
    of deployment.


    <BR />
    ### LP Locked forever
    To add to the trust issues, oftentimes the LP of projects is either not locked or locked for short periods of time.
    This is another reason why some projects never take off.
    Having access to the LP tokens enables those that have provided the LP to take it away leaving the project with no
    resources to enable swaps. This is commonly known as “rug pulling”.
    With HABEO, we want to eliminate all of the possible scenarios that create trust issues.
    That’s why we lock the LP tokens forever.
    Meaning NO ONE, EVER can take the initial liquidity away.

    <BR />
    ### Donations for the dev team
    Because we’ve created a very good project that we hope will grow into a magnificent community, we wanted to create a
    feature that would allow for donations to the dev team.
    Simply send BNB to the contract address anytime AFTER the early distribution period is done and the contract will
    forward them to our wallet.
    You can also send any token to our developer wallet directly if you would rather do that.

    <BR />
    <BR />
    ## Roadmap
    We have decided to create HABEO in an attempt to enable as many people as possible to interact with crypto.
    We think that only by moving in this direction, crypto will truly become universal and will solve some of the
    world’s economic inequities.

    However, we have noticed that creating the best token is only part of the solution as there are at least three big
    bumps on the road that we also want to contribute to eradicate.

    The first one, is knowledge. Crypto is still an enigma for the vast majority of the world.
    Second, availability is not the same for different parts of the world. We can see daily how certain tools are
    available in some places and not others.
    Last but not least, ease of use. We think that this one goes hand in hand with knowledge but let's face it,
    obtaining crypto usually involves many steps and some of them involve some level of technical knowledge.

    As we are giving HABEO away to the community, we are enabling all participants to contribute and become part of the
    solution.

    There are some steps in our vision that are going to be easily achieved and some others that will take a large
    collaborative effort and a decent amount of time to become a reality.

    We think that in an ideal world, we could have a blockchain that is inclusive enough to allow everyone to
    participate with very little effort.
    Although this might sound like wishful thinking, having a strong community seeking that goal will definitely make it
    more achievable.

    We can't say that this is a true roadmap in the way a traditional roadmap works but, these are the steps that we
    hope we can achieve as a community.

    If we ever reach the point in which we can make our final vision a reality, it will be after we strengthen our
    community.
    A good way to strengthen our community is to enable everyone to contribute with whatever skills they can bring to
    the table.
    We have thought of several milestones (both short-term and mid-term) that we think can help create the environment
    of collaborative effort that will give us the most chances of succeeding at accomplishing the end goal.

    <BR />
    ### Short term goals

    <BR />
    #### Create a supportive educational community
    As explained above, two of the main blockers for the widespread use of tokens can be resolved with education:


    * **Difficulty of use**: Although tokens and all cryptos are becoming more accessible, there are many hoops to jump
    through in order to be able to acquire the desired tokens.
    * **Lack of education**: A large portion of the public using tokens has no clue what they are doing and once they
    had a bad experience, they are scared from using tokens ever again.

    Although we know that making the token available in multiple exchanges can be beneficial, we think that the first
    step we need to take in order to tackle these issues is to create a community that focuses on training and education
    of its members.
    We want to provide training and tools that will enable anyone interested in using HABEO in particular and tokens in
    general, to understand and have confidence using crypto.
    No matter what level of understanding they have at the time of joining, they will be able to achieve their goals by
    leaning on a supportive community and learn as much as they are willing to in the process.

    As part of this effort, our website will be hosting training in the form of documents and video.
    Because we want our community to be inclusive, all documents will be translated to as many languages as possible
    (with the help of our community). We want everyone in the world to have a fair chance at learning and using HABEO
    with confidence.
    Our videos will be recorded in a few languages and the transcripts will be translated to the same languages as the
    documents.

    Our team has kickstarted the process of education in English, Spanish and Portuguese while also giving Italian and
    French a try.

    With the help of the community, this can be an ever improving goal that has already started.

    <BR />
    _ETA_: Already in progress.

    <BR />
    #### Availability in multiple exchanges
    Initially, we will focus our efforts on making the token available to current users while strengthening the
    community.
    We started by listing HABEO in PancakeSwap. After the token becomes live, we can start onboarding other exchanges.
    Although being available in multiple exchanges will help with the reach to other potential users, we think the best
    way to manage this is organically so there's no need of investing a large amount of time and resources to accomplish
    it.
    HABEO is ready from the get go to onboard other exchanges. Our vision is: "If we build it, they will come".

    <BR />
    _ETA_: This will be a continuous moving target. We anticipate that we will have several exchanges reach out by the
    end of the year 2021 but we won't sweat if this is not the case.

    <BR />
    ### Mid term goals

    <BR />
    #### Creating bridges with other blockchains
    The logical next step is to enable users from other blockchains to have the ability to use HABEO and its community.
    In order to accomplish this, we would need to create bridges to other blockchains.
    It is probably a good idea to first work with the ETH network because of the similitude with the BSC Network.
    If other networks are worthy, our community can always focus resources in building the new bridges.

    <BR />
    _ETA_: Seems like a good checkpoint to reach before thinking about a bridge would be once HABEO reaches critical
    mass (100,000 users approximately) and our community becomes self-sufficient with regards to administering our
    forums. We anticipate this being the scenario by Q1 2022.

    <BR />
    #### HABEO Wallet
    There are several wallet products out there that have the ability to work with BSC tokens.
    If our community decides to build "the one wallet to rule them all", we'll have to make sure it covers the most
    important aspects that other wallets don't cover.
    Since our goals are simplicity, education and availability, the wallet would have to follows those principles.
    It would have to be: multi chain, multi protocol, multi language and with integrated conversion tools.

    <BR />
    _ETA_: This work could be started at any point in time. We should not focus efforts if it is not needed. I would
    think that a good target date to start would be Q2 2022.

    <BR />
    #### HABEO Exchange
    The exchange should come after the wallet. Even though a new wallet would integrate with some of the existing
    exchanges, our community can build a new exchange that falls in line with the culture of HABEO’s community.
    It should follow our principles for simplicity, education and availability.

    <BR />
    _ETA_: We think that this should not be part of the efforts until at least the end of 2022.

    <BR />
    ### Long term goals

    <BR />
    #### HABEO blockchain
    Arriving to this place would mean that what was initially an utopia, is now a very real posibility.

    As we explained early on this document, we think that what will give HABEO the most chances of helping people around
    the world and solving their inability to participate in the crypto world is to be running on its own blockchain.

    HABEO's blockchain should be a Proof Of Stake blockchain that uses the most efficient algorithms to validate
    transactions cheaply, quickly and securely.

    We must make sure that we have the best and most efficient blockchain for our community while also making sure that
    we are not affecting the environment in a negative way.

    The method in which this goal can be achieved should be discussed over time but, as a first idea, it seems that we
    could base our development on a ETH 2.0 fork.

    <BR />
    _ETA_: As every other goal, this one could be moved up or down based on the strength of our community. Initially, it
    seems that Q4 2023 could be a good target.
