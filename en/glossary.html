# Crypto 101 Glossary - In layman's terms
<br /><br />
#### Crypto Coin

A digital object that is generated and maintained by a **_blockchain network_**.

<BR />
#### Blockchain Network

A decentralized network of computers running a program that keeps them communicated
and sharing information between them. One important piece of information that these
computers share is a secured ledger that describes all of the transactions involving
their managed coins that have happened since the inception of the network.

<BR />
#### Crypto Token

Contrary to popular belief, a crypto token is not the same as a **crypto coin**. As described
above, a coin is maintained and managed by a **blockchain network**. A token on the other hand
does not have its own network. It runs instead, on top of an existing crypto coin.
The first widely known example of this is the Ethereum network that allows for the existence
of **_ERC-20_** tokens. The one HABEO runs on top of is the Binance Smart Chain (BSC for short)
network that allows for the existence of **_BEP-20_** tokens.
Tokens are digital objects and are maintained and tracked by a **_Smart Contract_**.

<BR />
#### Smart Contract
These are short computer programs that run on top of a **crypto coin’s** **blockchain network** and are
immutable (they run forever without being able to be modified).
These contracts create **crypto tokens** and other digital objects and follow a predefined set of
rules for their management and administration.

<BR />
#### ERC-20 and BEP-20
These are standards for the creation of **crypto tokens**. Basically, they are a set of rules that
all tokens must follow. ERC-20 is the standard for the **Ethereum network** whereas BEP-20 is the one
for the **BSC network**.
The two are very much the same since the BEP-20 standard is 100% based on the ERC-20 standard.
However, they might start drifting away from each other in the future.

<BR />
#### Wallet
Most people that are new to crypto objects believe that wallets are some sort of physical device
or a computer program. The truth is that even though wallets can be “managed” by physical devices
or computer programs, they are simply an address. That’s it, a wallet is just an address in the
**blockchain network** they belong to.
Basically, there are two components that make up this address, a private key and a public key.
The public key is usually referred to as the “address” itself. This address is public and anyone
knowing it can only use it to send digital objects to it. Nothing else.
On the other hand, the private key (the other part of the wallet) needs to be kept, as the name
indicates, private.
The private key is what allows users to spend or transfer their digital objects.
Some programs that manage wallets don’t allow users to manage or even see their private keys and
keep them hidden so they can only be used by the program when necessary. Some other programs do
allow for users to manage their private keys. They both have their benefits that we’ll discuss at
some other point.

<BR />
#### Transferring, spending or swapping digital objects
Basically, they are all the same from a technical perspective. Both, transferring and spending,
mean sending objects from one **wallet** to another.
The wallet receiving the objects is usually an individual’s wallet.
Swapping on the other hand, also means sending an object to another wallet but, in this particular
case, the destination wallet would be an **_exchange_** or a **smart contract**.

<BR />
#### Exchange
An exchange is a program (**smart contract**) that allows for the swapping of some digital objects
for other digital objects or the usage of FIAT currency (Dollars, Euros, etc.) to acquire or dispose
of digital objects.
When obtaining digital objects, the user utilizes FIAT currencies from a bank account or credit card
to fund their exchange account. Once money is deposited, they can choose from the variety of digital objects
that the exchange offers to acquire.
Not all exchanges offer all digital objects and some digital objects are not available in every exchange.
So, sometimes multiple “swaps” need to happen for a user to be able to obtain a specific digital object.
For the Ethereum network, some of these swaps are done through a platform called **_Uniswap_** (and others).
For the BSC network, the most common platform is **_PancakeSwap_**.

<BR />
#### Uniswap and PancakeSwap
These platforms are examples of what’s called an Automatic Market Maker (AMM for short). AMMs allow for a
swap to happen even when there is no offer or demand available.
In regular **exchanges** (like in the stock market), anytime someone wants to acquire an object needs to coincide
in time and price with an offering party. Viceversa, when someone wants to dispose, needs to coincide with someone
that wants to acquire at that price point. Once the two parties agree on the value, the operation is executed and
the objects change hands.
With AMMs, the need for both parties to coincide in value and time is replaced by a concept called **_Liquidity
Pool_**
that enables these trades to happen when only one party is present.

<BR />
#### Liquidity Pool
For the trades mentioned above to happen, there needs to be “something” interested in accepting the digital objects
the user is using to trade and the same “something” interested in letting go of the digital objects the user is
looking to acquire.
That “something” is called a Liquidity Pool (LP for short).
Liquidity Pools offer “pairs” of tokens/coins to trade. For instance, a LP that serves a Token1/Token2 pair,
allows for Token1 being traded for Token2 and vice versa. This enables users to offer a certain amount of Token1
to acquire a certain amount of Token2 and the other way around too.
When these pairs are created, they are provided an arbitrary amount of each token. At that very moment, the “value”
of both tokens (in relationship to the other) is determined in the LP. Depending on the proportion in which the
tokens
are initially provided, their value related to each other will be different.
If the pool is created with 100 units of Token1 and 10 units of Token2, then the value for each Token2 would be 10
Token1 and the value for each Token1 would be 0.1 Token2.
With every transaction that happens, users are either adding Token1 to the pool and taking Token2 from the pool, or
vice
versa.
These operations create imbalances in the proportion of the tokens used for liquidity on the pool thus making the
“value”
go up, or down in relationship to the other.
However, if a user is looking to acquire Token2 but only wants to offer Token3, the transaction will not be possible
unless
the LP serves the Token2/Token3 pair too.
This way, for certain scenarios, a user might need to trade a couple times before obtaining the desired object.
One more important detail to know about LPs is that the liquidity is provided by users/contracts.
This means that either a contract or a user had to create the “pair” by providing an arbitrary amount of Token1 and
Token2
for that pair to exist and be useful.
After the pair is created, any number of users can add liquidity but they all need to add it in a balanced way at
whatever
the price of Token1 compared to Token2 is at that time.
When users or contracts add liquidity to an LP, they receive what is called **_LP-Tokens_** in exchange.

<BR />
#### LP-Tokens
LP-Tokens can have different names (in PancakeSwap they are called CAKE-LP) but they all serve the same purpose.
The LP-token is a sort of a cashier’s check certifying that the account that received the LP-tokens, owns that
portion of the
**liquidity** and can remove it at any time by just “returning” the LP-tokens.
If enough liquidity is removed, the token pair becomes untradeable and people owning the objects cannot trade them
in that platform.
This is commonly known as a **_rug pull_**.
This is why it is important that any new digital object being created, offers at least some period of “Locked
Liquidity”.
When a token states that its liquidity is “Locked”, it means that the LP-tokens are kept in a time locked mechanism
in which they
cannot be used to redeem the liquidity for a determined period of time.
There is also the alternative to “renounce” the LP-tokens effectively locking the affected liquidity forever.
HABEO locks its liquidity forever by renouncing it. The initial liquidity provided at the end of the early
distribution and the
subsequent additions to liquidity that the contract generates over time through **_Auto-LP_** are renounced by
**burning** the CAKE-LP received
by the contract.

<BR />
#### Rug Pull
This is a scam practice that is very common in new projects with digital objects.
The owner of the token provides very little initial liquidity and enables the token to be traded.
All early participants start acquiring the token with highly valued objects (for example BNB) accepted by the
exchange as a pair to
the newly created token.
This sudden influx of valued objects creates an imbalance sending the value of the new object suddenly skyrocketing
which in turn makes
other people want to jump into the race further accelerating the value action.
Once scammers feel the loot is good, they have two main avenues to finish their scam:
They can use their LP-tokens to redeem their initial liquidity that is now highly imbalanced towards very little
“new token” and a lot
of highly valued objects (for example BNB).
They can dispose of a very large amount of their token by trading it for BNB leaving very little liquidity for the
rest of the world to operate.

<BR />
#### Taxes
Certain transactions with tokens on the smart contracts are taxed, meaning that a percentage of the amount of tokens
being sent is retained
by the smart contract.
There are a few different uses that are given to these taxes.
Most contracts implement a combination of: **_reflection_**, **Auto-LP**, **_token burning_** and **_dev-team
fees_**.
HABEO has a very innovative tax structure that favors token users and long time holders and limits day traders.

<BR />
#### Reflection
Is a method by which smart contracts provide a sort of dividend to the wallets that hold their tokens.
Basically, some of the transactions with the tokens are taxed and part of those taxes are distributed evenly and
proportionally among the
users that hold any amount of tokens from the contract. This way, users holding the object see their balances grow
by just holding their tokens.
HABEO implements a very aggressive reflection strategy.

<BR />
#### Auto-LP
This is a method by which contracts continuously add liquidity (pair of tokens) to the **LP** with which they are
operating.
This is useful to allow an increased number of transactions to be successful assuring the LP always has Token1 and
Token2 available for trading.
HABEO continuously adds liquidity.

<BR />
#### Token Burning
Burning tokens means that contracts (or users) voluntarily send tokens to an inaccessible wallet (generally the
wallet with address 0x00..)
so those tokens are removed from circulation permanently.
This creates a situation in which fewer and fewer tokens are available in the market creating market pressure and
because of the result of
offer and demand imbalance, increase the price of the token.
This is comparable to having 5 rare coins (let’s say, US quarters) valued at $1000 each and suddenly throwing one
into a furnace. Now there’s
only 4 coins left so the price of each of the remaining ones will increase because their rarity has increased.
HABEO burned 50% of the available tokens right at the close of the early distribution and will continuously burn
tokens until the supply
becomes 2.5% of the original amount.

<BR />
#### Dev-Team fees
These are fees that some contracts implement to become a sort of payment to the dev team that has created the
contract.
HABEO has no Dev-Team fees. But, it accepts donations.

<BR />
#### Bridges
Bridges are Smart Contracts that allow for the usage of tokens that live in one blockchain in a different
blockchain.
The way they work is that they receive the original token in its blockchain, they lock it and they mint an
equivalent number of “wrapped”
tokens in the other blockchain.
This way, users can now use their newly wrapped tokens in the new blockchain to swap them for objects that live on
it.
When users want to move the tokens back to their original blockchain, they simply send them to the contract, the
contract burns the wrapped
tokens and frees the original tokens on their original blockchain.
