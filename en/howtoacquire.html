# HABEO - How to acquire
<br /><br />
## Experienced users (users that have swapped multiple tokens before)

<BR />
### Early distribution
Early distribution is self hosted and very simple to use.
From your wallet, simply send the right amount of BNB to HABEOâ€™s address and the contract will send the right amount
of tokens back to your wallet, once the transacion is confirmed.
One important call out for the early distribution is to let the wallet freely calculate the gas so the transaction
is not failed because of it not being enough.
If the transaction does fail because of low gas, try again offering a higher gas limit.

<BR />
### Pancakeswap swaps
Swaps for HABEO are like any BEP-20 tokens swap.
The contract number is **0xXXXXXX**.
Because of the taxes, you should leave the slippage percentage high. The usual recommended value is 12% since most
tokens have 10% taxes. As the tax to acquire HABEO is lower (2%) a smaller slippage of around 4% will likely work
but leaving it at 12% should not have any negative impact and will make sure the transaction goes through.
When swapping out of HABEO, the tax varies depending on the percentage of the wallet being swapped so, slippage will
need to be tweaked accordingly.

## Intermediate users (users that have wallets but have not swapped tokens before)

### Early distribution

Early distribution is self hosted so, acquiring HABEO during this period is as easy as sending BNB to any wallet.
HABEO's contract is designed to accept any of a set of predefined amounts of BNB hardcoded into it.
The protocol is listening to any wallets that send those exact amounts of BNB to the contract address and then,
after the transaction has been verified by the Binance Smart Chain network, the contract assigns the corresponding
amount of HABEO to the wallet sending the BNB.
As wallets periodically request balance updates to the contracts that host the tokens, once the tokens have been
assigned, it's a matter of waiting until the next balance refresh for the new balance to be shown.
As each wallet has its own schedule request updates, timing may vary but most do it quite often (every few
seconds/minutes).
Some wallets require that you enable the displaying of the new token amount through their settings (TrustWallet is
an example of this).
Some others, might need that you add the token with a manual process (Metamask is an example of this).
If you are working with Metamask, tap the _"Add Token"_ button and enter the contract addess (**0xXXXXXX**) in the
_"Token Contract Address"_ box.
Tap on _"Next"_ after that and the amount of tokens will display on your wallet.

### Pancakeswap swaps

Pancakeswap is what's defined as a _"DeFi"_ exchange.
These exchanges have multiple capabilities but the main purpose they serve is to enable the exchange of coins/tokens
for one another, just like any other exchange.
The main difference with the way regular exchanges work is that DeFi exchanges don't need an agreement between two
parties to do the exchange.
They work with a format called _"Liquidity Pools" (LPs for short)_ that eliminates that need. These LPs are
basically a group of large quantities of tokens/coins held by the exchange in a proportional pair format.
For instance, once the early distribution is done, Pancakeswap will host the pair BNB/HABEO.
For the sake of easy understanding, let's use small numbers for this example.
Let's say that the BNB/HABEO pair has 10 BNB and 1000 HABEO. If you wanted to exchange BNB for HABEO, for every BNB
that you bring to the transaction you would be able to swap it for 100 HABEO. To be as close to exact as possible
with our example, we must clarify that this is not an exact number because the swap in this example would represent
a large amount of tokens in the pool but, for the regular use of the exchange, this example is pretty close to what
would happen.
If you were to swap HABEO for BNB, you would have to provide 100 HABEO for every BNB that you wish to acquire.
After each transaction, the proportion is changed since the LP will now have different amounts on each side of the
pair so, the value and proportion keep changing with each swap, setting the new price.
In order to interact with Pancakeswap, you will have to navigate to https://pancakeswap.finance/. Once there, the
website will offer you to _"Connect your wallet"_ which means that Pancakeswap will be able to read the wallet's
balances.
After the wallet is connected, click on the _"Trade"_ option on the top menu which will bring you to the Exchange
page.
This is the page that allows to exchange one coin/token for another.
To acquire HABEO, in the _"from"_ section, select BNB and enter the amount of BNB you are looking to exchange. Next,
you need to select what token you are looking to obtain in the _"to"_ section.
As the names of the tokens can be reused by other contraxcts, **ALWAYS** use the contract address to identify the
right token.
You will see a list of tokens and a space to enter a contract address, paste HABEO's contract address there.
One more thing to consider is what is called _"Slippage tolerance"_. As we described above, if a transaction affects
the amounts of either of the tokens in the LP too much, the proportion change will affect the amount of tokens that
can get acquired with your offered amount.
To prevent the transaction from cancelling and costing you gas in vain, it is usually a good idea with BEP-20 tokens
to set the slippage tolerance to a value of around 12%. There's a settings icon that you can tap on to set this
value.

### Early distribution

In order to be able to swap tokens in any exchange, you need to have a crypto wallet.
There are different types of wallets that work with different crypto networks. Some of them can work with multiple
networks at once.
To work with BEP-20 tokens (HABEO is a BEP-20 token), you will need to use a wallet that supports this network.
There are a large number of wallets that you could use but for these examples we'll be talking about TrustWallet and
Metamask.
The reason we are providing examples for two wallets is because both of them have an important distinction from the
other.

<BR />
#### TrustWallet
The main differentiator for TrustWallet is that it allows to add FIAT (regular money as Dollars, Euros and such)
funds to the wallet that they can then be used for acquiring coins and tokens.
At the time of this writing, TrustWallet interacts with Simplex and Moonpay for getting FIAT currencies into the
wallet.
Both of them allow you to use Visa, Mastercard and ApplePay to fund the wallets. Some banks don't allow their issued
cards to be used for crypto so you might get a transaction rejected when trying it.
You can use trial and error or contact your bank to ask about it.
The main downside of TrustWallet is that it is only available for iOS and Android with no PC/Mac versions.

<BR />
#### Metamask Wallet
Metamask does not allow to fund wallets. So, in order to be able to work with Metamask, you will have to receive
crypto into the wallet by means of a transfer from another wallet.
Another option (more complex) is to create another wallet in an exchange like Binance or Coinbase (there are a lot
of different options for exchanges), fund that new wallet with FIAT currency, acquire some form of crypto currency
with these funds and then, transfer these funds into the Metamask wallet.
If you are reading this, we understand that you are new to the crypto world so we would strongly suggest that you
avoid unnecessary steps at least for now.
The one great thing about Metamask is that it runs as a plug-in for Firefox and Chrome so you can literally use it
in any PC/Mac AND it also has an iOS and an Android versions.

<BR />
So, if you want to only work with your mobile phone, we would recommend that you start with TrustWallet because if
covers all you need.
But, if you are looking to work with both PC/Mac AND mobile, we recommend that you install TrustWallet in your phone
and Metamask in your computer. Once that's done, fund your TrustWalelt account, acquire BNB with it and then
transfer the BNB to your Metamask wallet. You can then also install Metamask in your phone so you can manage your
wallet from both places.
Once the BNB is in your Metamask wallet, you can start swapping coins/tokens either from the computer or from the
phone.
There are a lot more details and options but, as a new user, you want to stick with these for a time until you
acquire more knowledge and experience.
